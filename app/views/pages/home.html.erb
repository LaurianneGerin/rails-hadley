        <div class="home--content">
          <p>Most farmers in developing countries practice rain-fed agriculture. Not enough rain means plants don’t produce a harvest while too much rain can kill
            growing crops. To protect against natural hazards and climate risk, farmers can insure themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Yet the existing network of low rain density gauges and the short historical time periods prevent a suitable risk coverage.

          <p>Hadley Innovation overcomes the challenge of missing information, by simulating realistic rainfall data. Known as <em>stochastic modeling of space-time rainfall field, </em>
            our simulator accounts for the spatial and temporal dependence of rainfall patterns.
          </p>
          <p>From ground observations measurements, statistical analysis of rainfall distribution is first achieved to infer input parameters in the rainfall simulator.
            In output, relevant information are generated at locations with no previous measurements, or where only short data series are available. Synthetic rainfall
            data improve weather index design while lowering premiums' costs, making insurance more affordable.

        <div class="home--content">
          <p>Allowing the 50 million smallholders farmers across sub-Saharan Africa to benefit from cheap, transparent and tailor-made
            insurance coverage against climate risk. The model Hadley Innovation is developing represents a small part of what needs to be achieved to
            properly design and price a weather index. Cross disciplinary collaborations from different disciplines - geostatistics, climatology, agronomy and finance
            - are thus required to end-up with a whole product with strong value for smallholders’ farmers.
