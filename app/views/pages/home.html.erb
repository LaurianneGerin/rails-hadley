        <p>Most farmers in sub-Saharan Africa practice rain-fed agriculture. Not enough rain means plants don’t produce a harvest while too much rain can kill
          growing crops. To mitigate adverse effects of heavy rainfall or drought on crop yield, weather index insurance is an innovative risk management solution,
          mostly intended to insure smallholders’ farmers against climate risk. The weather index insurance is based on an event’s probability to trigger a payout
          from independent meteorological data, which both farmer and insurer have access to
        </p>
        <p>Yet, the poor rain gauge network in sub-Saharan Africa prevents a proper risk assessment and an accurate insurance design. If the spatial and temporal
          variability of rainfall is not accurately estimated, only areas covered by a dense rain gauge network with long histories can benefit from insurance
          coverage.

        <p>Hadley Innovation overcomes the challenge of missing information by simulating realistic rainfall data, away from gauge stations. Known as <em>stochastic modeling of space-time rainfall field, </em>
          our simulator accounts for the spatial and temporal dependence of rainfall patterns.
        </p>
        <p>From ground observations measurements, statistical analysis of rainfall distribution is first achieved to infer input parameters in the rainfall simulator.
          In output, relevant information are generated at locations with no previous measurements, or where only short data series are available. Synthetic rainfall
          data improve weather index design while lowering premiums' costs, making insurance more affordable.

      <div class="col-md-6 content">
        <p>The vision of Hadley Innovation lies in allowing the 50 million smallholders farmers across sub-Saharan Africa to benefit from cheap, transparent and tailor-made
          insurance coverage against climate risk. The rainfall model Hadley Innovation is developing represents a small part of what needs to be achieved to
          properly design and price a weather index. Cross disciplinary collaborations from different disciplines - geostatistics, climatology, agronomy and finance
          - are thus required to end-up with a whole product with strong value for smallholders’ farmers.
